1. Get a Solana wallet
Metamask and other Ethereum-like wallets won’t work for Solana.
We are advising to use Fantom Wallet.
Phantom is a best option for an in-browser extension for Chrome, Firefox, Brave, etc ... and also it has native NFT support.
You can see yours NFTs directly in the wallet and don't need to visit NFT marketplaces or some others sites for it.
When setting up a new wallet, Phantom will give you a 12-word seed phrase to write down or store somewhere, in case you need to restore your wallet at some point. Set a password, confirm, and then you’re in.
(Note: This seed phrase is the key to unlocking your funds. Anyone with this phrase can access them, so keep it in a safe place and don’t share it with anyone who you don’t want accessing your wallet.)

2) Get some SOL.
Our minting price is 2 SOL but we advise to have at least 2.1 SOL in the wallet for networks fee.
With Phantom, there are a few different ways to get the SOL coins into your wallet:

- One option is simply to purchase Solana at an exchange and then send it to your wallet.
For example:
- Binance: https://www.binance.com/en/trade/SOL_USDT
- KuCoin: https://trade.kucoin.com/SOL-USDT
(full list of supported exchanges can be foud here: https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/solana/markets/)

Phantom also offers direct integration with cryptocurrency exchange FTX, making it easy to deposit funds held within that exchange
- FTX: https://ftx.com/trade/SOL/USDT

3. Mint NFT
Once you have 2+ SOL in yours Fantom wallet, all you have to do:
- go to our mint web-page https://elvensquad.solardust.io/
- push the button "Connect Wallet"
- wait till 7pm UTC
And as soon as the  countdown timer expires, "mint" button will appear
-Push "Mint" button, and approve the transaction in your wallet.
